### Project Abstract:
This study attempts to answer one main question: what inherited and acquired traits
and general factors significantly influence mortality from heart disease? We chose 4 variables
to explore: age, high cholesterol, diabetes, and gender. Using 2-sample t-tests, Chi-square
goodness-of-fit tests, and a logistic regression model, we explored which factors are significant
to mortality in heart disease patients, which we found all are significant. This is consistent
with outside research our team has found.
