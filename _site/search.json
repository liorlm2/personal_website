Our dataset initially had 24 variables, and in order to correctly predict the game outcome we transformed the dataset only keeping 3 of the original variables and adding 26 new ones. Our model attempts to predict the 101st game and beyond using data from the previous games. After performing a 70-30 training testing split, we ran Logistic Regression, LDA, KNN, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and SVM with a variety of hyper-parameters to find KNN as our best model with a testing accuracy of 66%."
